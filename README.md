Project Title:   
Predictive Modelling with Linear Regression using Advertising Expenditure dataset    

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to perform Predictive Modelling using Linear Regression. The goal is to developed a Linear Regression model to predict sales based on advertising spending across three channels: TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The aim was to understand how different advertising mediums influence sales and build a predictive model for sales optimization.   

Key Activities:  
Data Cleaning      

Ensured the dataset was free of inconsistencies, handled missing values, and standardized the format of the data. This step was crucial for making sure the data was reliable and ready for analysis.
Model Development     

Split the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model's performance. Trained the Linear Regression model on the training data and validated it on the testing data to ensure accurate predictions.
Performance Evaluation
Evaluated the model's performance using key metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measured the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values, helping to assess the accuracy of the model.
R-squared (RÂ²): Calculated to understand how well the model fits the data, indicating the proportion of variance in the target variable (sales) that the model explains.
Visual Insights

Regression Lines: Plotted regression lines to visually inspect how well the model fits the data and captures the relationship between advertising
spending and sales.
Actual vs Predicted Sales: Used scatter plots to compare the predicted sales against the actual sales, providing a visual representation of the model's accuracy and helping to identify any discrepancies.
Technology Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas: For data loading, manipulation, and cleaning.
NumPy: For handling numerical operations and missing values.
Matplotlib: For basic plotting and data visualization.
Seaborn: For advanced visualizations like heatmaps, box plots, and count plots.
Scikit-learn: Building and evaluating the Linear Regression model
Insights:
TV Advertising:

The strongest predictor of sales. The data revealed a robust positive correlation, indicating that higher TV spending directly drives sales growth.
Radio Advertising:

Shows a notable correlation with sales, though not as strong as TV. Radio ads have a consistent, yet smaller, impact on sales, suggesting they play a supportive role in driving consumer interest.
Newspaper Advertising:

The weakest link in this analysis. The correlation between newspaper spending and sales was minimal, pointing to diminishing returns or lower effectiveness of print advertising in this dataset.
Overall Impact:

TV and Radio are more influential in driving sales compared to Newspaper, which could suggest a shift in marketing strategies towards more modern, dynamic media channels (like TV and digital media).

Conclusion:
The project strengthened my understanding of building predictive models and exploring the relationship between variables. Through Linear Regression, I was able to not only predict sales but also identify key drivers of sales performance. The use of visualizations helped in uncovering the most influential advertising channels, guiding future strategic decisions for sales optimization.

Future Scope:
Incorporating additional features like seasonality, promotion activities, and competitor spending would likely provide a more comprehensive view of sales dynamics.
Experimenting with Decision Trees, Random Forest, or XGBoost could improve prediction accuracy by capturing non-linear relationships in the data.
Implementing the model for real-time sales prediction would allow businesses to adjust marketing strategies dynamically based on incoming data.
